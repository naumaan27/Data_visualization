# ðŸ“Š Retail Store Sales Analysis Dashboard

## Project Overview
This Power BI / Tableau  project addresses key business questions from the CEO and CMO of a retail company by creating **data-driven visuals** to support decision-making. The analysis focuses on understanding **seasonal revenue trends, top-performing countries, high-value customers, and global product demand** to inform future strategies.

## Data Preparation & Cleaning

Before conducting the analysis, the following **data cleaning steps** were performed:
- âœ… **Removed entries where Quantity < 1** to exclude returns and incorrect sales entries.
- âœ… **Removed entries where Unit Price < $0** to ensure data accuracy.

Data cleaning was performed using **Power BI / Tableau â€™s Power Query Editor** with conditional filtering and transformation techniques to ensure only valid records were used in the analysis.
